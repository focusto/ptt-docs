This document explains the API access rights, usage limits, and billing models for our different plans.

## Plan Breakdown

| Feature | Free Plan | Premium Plan | Enterprise Plan |

| **Monthly Fee** | $0 | $30 | **$49.90** |
| **API Access** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

### Free Plan
The Free plan does **not** include API access. To use the API, please upgrade to a paid plan.

### Premium Plan
- **Model**: Subscription-based with a fixed monthly quota.
- **Access**: Your active subscription grants you **10,000** API calls per month.
- **Limit**: If you exhaust your 10,000 calls, API access will be paused until your quota resets on your next billing date.

### Enterprise Plan
- **Model**: A hybrid model with a base subscription fee and pay-as-you-go for additional usage.
- **Base Subscription**: The **$49.90/month** fee includes **20,000** API calls.
- **Overage**: If you exceed the 20,000 included calls, you can purchase additional **Credit Packs** on-demand. These credits do not expire.
- **Credit Pack Pricing**: The price per credit becomes cheaper as you buy larger packs (volume discount). For example:
    - **1 - 9,999 Credits**: $0.004 / credit
    - **10,000 - 99,999 Credits**: $0.0025 / credit
    - **100,000+ Credits**: Contact us for custom pricing.

This structure provides a clear path for scaling your usage. Start with the cost-effective Premium plan and move to the flexible, high-volume Enterprise plan as your needs grow.
